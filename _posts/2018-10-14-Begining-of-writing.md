Thr pen is mightier than the sword.

I've had the intent to start writing for some time now, but never got to it.

Some of the first articles where half written quite some time ago. Main reasons
for staring this blog are:

- Learn to write better and express myself better. Having good grammar and ability 
    to express yourself is a valuable skill as for personal and career opportunities. 
    Dijkstra even went as far as to state that a good programmer has to have a 
    nice handwriting. The silent people like myself have to cope with it somehow.
- Learn to reason better and explain my ideas and arguments more axiomatically.
    
- Indulge into the community of programmers
- Note some interesting stuff so I don't want forget it myself


As i've taken the challenge of writing, I hope to make a scientific paper 
by the end of the academic year, so my first topic will be reading as many 
papers as I can and write a short summary on them here.
